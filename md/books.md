#### Memoirs of a Revolutionist _(Pyotr Alexeyvich Kropotkin)_
> [Having been brought up in a serf-owner's family, I entered active life, like all young men of my time, 
  with a great deal of confidence in the necessity of commanding, ordering, scolding, punishing and the like.
  But when, at an early stage, I had to manage serious enterprises and to deal with [free] men, and when each 
  mistake would lead at once to heavy consequences, I began to appreciate the difference between acting on the 
  principle of command and discipline and acting on the principle of common understanding. The former works 
  admirably in a military parade, but it is worth nothing where real life is concerned, and the aim can be 
  achieved only through the severe effort of many converging wills.](https://archive.org/details/memoirsofrevolut01kropuoft/page/250/mode/1up?q=Having+been+brought+up+in+a+serf+owner%E2%80%99s+family)
